            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The goal of this assignment was to complete the full iterative design process in solving a design problem. I worked on a team with four other designers to create an interactive prototype from start to finish! We were paired up with a start up company called MiFonda.</p>
            <p>In this project, we were tasked to redesigned their Kitchen App experience. The app is used by their restaurant staff and managers to manage their menu items and orders quickly and easily.</p>

        <section id="problem">
            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <p>Here was our problem statement:</p>
            <i>How do we improve the user flow: category, item, modifiers and options? How can they be assessed in our app?</i>

            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <ul>
                <h3>Step 1: Sketching</h3>
                <p>In tackling this project, we began by having each member of the group sketch out 2 different user flows each with 4 distinct screens. We ended up having a total of 32 hand drawn sketches</p>

                <h3>Step 2: Low Fidelity wireframe</h3>
                <p>After viewing and comparing everyone's sketches, we sat as a group and decided which components we wanted to include in our low fidelity wireframe:</p>
                <img src="./images/iterative lofi.png" alt="this is a screenshot of our low fidelity wireframe" style="width: 60%">
                <h3>Step 3: Research + Feeback</h3>
                <p>A part of our research in completing this project was looking at competitors designs. We looked at competitors from "deliverect" and "otter" and also restaurant menu interfaces from "Chile's" and "Olive Garden". From our research, we found that a checkbox design for selecting items is more intuitive then the previous slider option.</p>
                <p>Throughout this process, we received feedback from the CTO and fellow classmates about our designs.</p>
                <p>Some of this feedback included:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>too much white space on the top</li>
                    <li>search bar is too small</li>
                    <li>image alignment isn't consistent across other screens</li>
                    <li>need to activate/deactivate full food item as well</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This feedback allowed us to make improvements to our designs</p>
                <h3>Step 4: High Fidelity Wireframe + Style Guide</h3>
                <p>Following the inital wireframings, we were ready for our high fidelity designs and our style guide.</p>
                <p>The style guide displays the main colors, typography, and reusable componentsâ€™ through variant states.</p>
                <img src="./images/Visual Style Guide.png" alt="style guide" style="width: 60%">
                <p>With the style guide completed, we created a hi-fi mockup. We designed the full workflow from the first iteration of the lofi and the additional features from our second iteration.</p>

            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>Here is what our final design looked like:</p>

            <p>When we finished our Figma design, we presented our current hifi design to our CEO and CTO synchronously over Zoom</p>
            <p>We received the following feedback:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>cross out the words when the item is deactivated</li>
                <li>make it more customizable with an "add more" sign to each dish</li>
                <li>image alignment isn't consistent across other screens</li>
                <li>adding more visual differentiations to represent active/inactive food items</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Takeaways</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Communication is key- especially when you are working closely with the stakeholders</li>
                <li>Constructive feedback allows us to make our projects better! Even the smallest changes elevated our final results</li>
                <li>Working as a team allows for a plethora of ideas! Being able to bounce and build ideas off of one another made our design stronger!</li>
            </ul>

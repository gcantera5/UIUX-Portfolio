                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>Books on the Square is an independent bookstore in Providence, Rhode Island located on Wayland Square. As a kid, my parents used to take me to Books on the Square on the weekends so I have many fond memories there. I selected this website because, as far as I can recall, it has remained unchanged since my middle school days. However, I believe the websiteâ€™s current format could benefit greatly from a cleaner, more modern design.</p>
                <p>The goal of this assignment was to practice the workflow of redesigning a simple website.</p>
                <p>We were challenged to chose any one page of a website and identify between effective and ineffective design elements in website's original interface. 
                <p>From there, we were asked to create low and high fidelity prototypes for various screen sizes, and build a responsive website using HTML/CSS based on our designs.</p>

        <section id="problem">
            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <p>Here are some usability problems I noticed with the original website:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The boldness and size of the headers vary in sizes which disrupts the visual hierarchy of the webpage</li>
                <li>The images of the books listed under the "#1 Bestsellers" section vary in size, and some of the book covers are challenging to read directly from the images</li>
                <li>Some elements on the page are not clearly identifiable as buttons, making it difficult for users to discern their interactive functionality</li>
                <li>Upcoming events could be presented in a more visually appealing format, such as utilizing a calendar layout, to enhance the overall aesthetic of the display</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Below is the a screenshot of the original design:</p>
